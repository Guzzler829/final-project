# Final Project - Seddit
Seddit is a very basic clone of the social media website Reddit.

### To do:
- Make post component (=========- 90%)
- Make comment component
- CRUD API operations for posting and reading posts and comments (========-- 80%)
- ~~Make comment markdown?~~ Nah.
- ~~Share function with dropdown for quickly sharing to common social medias~~ Really don't need this functionality. It's a *very basic* clone of Reddit after all.
- Make edit post method (FINISHED)
